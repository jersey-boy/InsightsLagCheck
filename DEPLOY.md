# Deploying as an AWS Lambda

This function pulls the "Zip State Federal District" Insights view, runs the two
validation checks, writes the CSV/XLSX reports to `/tmp`, uploads them to S3, and
returns presigned download URLs.

There are two packaging options:

- **Primary: zip + AWS-managed pandas layer** (recommended, no Docker). Covered
  below.
- **Fallback: container image** (see the [appendix](#appendix-container-image)).

The entry point is `pull_zip_state_federal.handler`.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with credentials that can create the function, role, and
  policies (`aws sts get-caller-identity` should work).
- Python 3.12 + pip locally (to build the deps zip).
- An S3 bucket for outputs (and, recommended, for the reference workbook).
- The NationBuilder Insights personal access token details.

Pick a region and reuse it everywhere below (examples use `us-east-1`).

---

## 2. Upload the reference workbook to S3

The ~4 MB `ZIP_Locale_Detail.xlsx` is not bundled; the function fetches it from
S3 at runtime via `ZIP_LOOKUP_S3_URI`.

```bash
aws s3 cp ZIP_Locale_Detail.xlsx s3://YOUR_BUCKET/refs/ZIP_Locale_Detail.xlsx
```

---

## 3. Store credentials in Secrets Manager

Put the NationBuilder credentials in a JSON secret. The keys must match the
`NB_INSIGHTS_*` names the code reads.

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name nb/insights/prod \
  --secret-string '{
    "NB_INSIGHTS_SERVER":"https://login.insights.nationbuilder.com",
    "NB_INSIGHTS_API_VERSION":"3.23",
    "NB_INSIGHTS_SITE_NAME":"your-site-name",
    "NB_INSIGHTS_SITE_URL":"your-site-url",
    "NB_INSIGHTS_TOKEN_NAME":"your-token-name",
    "NB_INSIGHTS_TOKEN_SECRET":"your-token-secret",
    "NATIONBUILDER_SLUG":"your-nation-slug",
    "NATIONBUILDER_ACCESS_TOKEN":"your-nationbuilder-api-token"
  }'
```

The `NATIONBUILDER_*` keys enable the federal-district cross-check (the function
loads them from this secret via `_load_secret_into_env`). Omit them to disable
the cross-check. If stored with a tool that adds a UTF-8 BOM, write the secret
without one (the loader strips a BOM defensively, but a clean secret is best).

Note the returned secret ARN.

---

## 4. Create the IAM execution role

The function needs to: write CloudWatch logs, read the secret, and read/write
the S3 outputs (write objects, and read them back to presign).

`trust-policy.json`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": { "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com" },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
  }]
}
```

`permissions-policy.json` (scope the ARNs to your bucket/secret):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Logs",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ReadSecret",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:ACCOUNT_ID:secret:nb/insights/prod-*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "S3ReadWrite",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Presigned GET URLs are signed locally from the role's credentials and need no
extra permission beyond `s3:GetObject`.

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name zipstatefed-lambda-role \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json

aws iam put-role-policy --role-name zipstatefed-lambda-role \
  --policy-name zipstatefed-permissions \
  --policy-document file://permissions-policy.json
```

---

## 5. Build the deployment zip

`build_lambda_zip.py` installs the non-pandas dependencies as **Linux wheels**
(so they run on Lambda even when built on Windows) and zips them with the two
source files. pandas/numpy are excluded — they come from the managed layer.

```bash
python build_lambda_zip.py
# -> lambda_deploy.zip  (~3 MB)
```

---

## 6. Find the managed pandas layer ARN

AWS SDK for pandas (formerly awswrangler) ships pandas + numpy as a managed
layer, published by AWS account `336392948345` in every commercial region:

```
arn:aws:lambda:<region>:336392948345:layer:AWSSDKPandas-Python312:<version>
```

Pick the latest `<version>` for your region from the AWS console (Lambda ->
Layers -> "Add a layer" -> AWS layers), or the
[AWS SDK for pandas install docs](https://aws-sdk-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).
Example used below: `...:AWSSDKPandas-Python312:13` (replace with the current one).

---

## 7. Create the function

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name zipstatefed-validation \
  --runtime python3.12 \
  --role arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/zipstatefed-lambda-role \
  --handler pull_zip_state_federal.handler \
  --zip-file fileb://lambda_deploy.zip \
  --layers arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:336392948345:layer:AWSSDKPandas-Python312:13 \
  --timeout 900 \
  --memory-size 1024 \
  --environment "Variables={
    OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp,
    S3_BUCKET=YOUR_BUCKET,
    S3_PREFIX=zip-state-reports/,
    S3_REGION=us-east-1,
    ZIP_LOOKUP_S3_URI=s3://YOUR_BUCKET/refs/ZIP_Locale_Detail.xlsx,
    NB_INSIGHTS_SECRET_ID=nb/insights/prod,
    NB_INSIGHTS_SECRET_REGION=us-east-1
  }"
```

Sizing notes:

- **Memory 1024 MB+**: the AWS SDK for pandas docs warn that <512 MB can be
  insufficient for pandas workloads; 178K rows + XLSX writing wants headroom.
  More memory also means more CPU, so it finishes faster.
- **Timeout 900 s** (the Lambda max): the Tableau pull plus XLSX generation, and
  especially the per-flagged-id NationBuilder cross-check (~1,000 API calls, run
  in parallel), need headroom. Without the cross-check, 300 s is enough.
- **/tmp**: the output files (six, or eight with the NB cross-check) total well
  under the 512 MB `/tmp` default.

To ship code updates later:

```bash
python build_lambda_zip.py
aws lambda update-function-code \
  --function-name zipstatefed-validation \
  --zip-file fileb://lambda_deploy.zip
```

---

## 8. Test the function

```bash
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name zipstatefed-validation \
  --payload '{}' response.json
cat response.json
```

A success looks like:

```json
{"statusCode": 200, "result": {"status": "OK", "rows": 178073,
 "zip_state_problems": 91, "federal_district_problems": 989,
 "insights_vs_nb_discrepancies": 56,
 "presigned_urls": ["https://YOUR_BUCKET.s3..."],
 "emailed_to": ["someone@example.com"]}}
```

`insights_vs_nb_discrepancies` is the row count of the third report
(`insights_vs_nationbuilder_*`), present only when NB credentials are set.

`presigned_urls` are per-object download links kept in the result for reference
(the dated S3 objects; valid up to 7 days). `emailed_to` lists who received the
attachment email. Errors are returned with `statusCode: 500` and an `error`
field, and the full traceback is in CloudWatch Logs.

---

## 9. Schedule it (optional)

Run nightly with EventBridge Scheduler:

```bash
aws scheduler create-schedule \
  --name zipstatefed-nightly \
  --schedule-expression "cron(0 6 * * ? *)" \
  --flexible-time-window '{"Mode":"OFF"}' \
  --target '{
    "Arn":"arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:ACCOUNT_ID:function:zipstatefed-validation",
    "RoleArn":"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/zipstatefed-scheduler-role"
  }'
```

The scheduler role needs `lambda:InvokeFunction` on the function. (Alternatively
use an EventBridge rule with `aws events put-rule` + `aws lambda add-permission`.)

---

## 10. Email the report links (optional, Amazon SES)

When `SES_SENDER` is set and a recipient list exists, the function emails the
two **problem reports as file attachments** (dated names) after the run. The
email includes the summary counts and a free-text message. The full dataset
(`zip_state_federal_district_*.csv/.xlsx`) is uploaded to S3 but **never
attached**. An attachment is skipped (with a note in the body) if it would push
the message past the SES ~10 MB limit. Email is independent of S3 — attachments
are read from the local output files.

> S3 object names are date-stamped with the run date
> (e.g. `zip_state_problems_YYYYMMDD.csv`) so a history accumulates in the
> bucket. Local file names stay undated.

> **Alternative (retained):** an earlier version emailed presigned S3 *links*
> instead of attachments. That path is preserved in `_build_link_email()` in
> `pull_zip_state_federal.py` (not called). To switch back, build the body with
> that helper and send via `ses.send_email` using the presigned URLs from
> `upload_to_s3()`.

### 10.1 Verify a sender identity

SES requires a verified sender. A domain identity gives the best deliverability;
if the domain is in Route 53, SES can add the DKIM records for you:

```bash
# Create the domain identity (returns 3 DKIM tokens):
aws sesv2 create-email-identity --email-identity YOUR_DOMAIN --region eu-west-2

# For each token, add a CNAME to the hosted zone:
#   <token>._domainkey.YOUR_DOMAIN  ->  <token>.dkim.amazonses.com
# (via aws route53 change-resource-record-sets). Verification completes
# automatically once the records propagate:
aws sesv2 get-email-identity --email-identity YOUR_DOMAIN --region eu-west-2 \
  --query "{Verified:VerifiedForSendingStatus, DKIM:DkimAttributes.Status}"
```

The sender address (`SES_SENDER`) can be any address on the verified domain
(e.g. `insights-reports@YOUR_DOMAIN`); no mailbox is required to send.

### 10.2 Sandbox vs. production

New SES accounts are in the **sandbox**: you can only send *to* verified
addresses. Check with:

```bash
aws sesv2 get-account --region eu-west-2 --query "ProductionAccessEnabled"
```

- While in the sandbox, verify each recipient too:
  `aws sesv2 create-email-identity --email-identity someone@example.com`
  (they click the confirmation link AWS emails them).
- To send to arbitrary recipients, request production access from the SES
  console (Account dashboard -> "Request production access"; ~24h to approve).

### 10.3 Recipient list

The list is a plain-text file (one address per line, `#` for comments) in S3:

```bash
aws s3 cp recipients.txt s3://YOUR_BUCKET/config/recipients.txt
```

Edit that S3 object to change who gets emailed — no redeploy needed.

### 10.4 IAM + env vars

Add `ses:SendEmail` to the execution role, scoped to the from-address (already
included in `aws/permissions-policy.json`):

```json
{
  "Sid": "SendEmail",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["ses:SendEmail", "ses:SendRawEmail"],
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "ses:FromAddress": "insights-reports@YOUR_DOMAIN" } }
}
```

Add these to the function environment (see `aws/lambda-env.json`):

```
SES_SENDER=insights-reports@YOUR_DOMAIN
SES_REGION=eu-west-2
RECIPIENTS_S3_URI=s3://YOUR_BUCKET/config/recipients.txt
```

Optional `EMAIL_MESSAGE` overrides the default body message (which explains why
both CSV and XLSX are provided — the leading-zero ZIP issue). Leave it unset to
use that default; set it to an empty string to omit the message.

---

## Appendix: container image

If you prefer a container image (e.g. dependencies grow, or you want exact
runtime parity), a `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` are included. This path does
**not** use the pandas layer — pandas is installed into the image from
`requirements.txt`.

```bash
# Build (requires the Docker engine running locally) and push to ECR:
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name zipstatefed-validation
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 \
  | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

docker build -t zipstatefed-validation .
docker tag zipstatefed-validation:latest \
  ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/zipstatefed-validation:latest
docker push ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/zipstatefed-validation:latest

# Create the function from the image (no --layers, no --runtime/--handler):
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name zipstatefed-validation \
  --package-type Image \
  --code ImageUri=ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/zipstatefed-validation:latest \
  --role arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/zipstatefed-lambda-role \
  --timeout 300 --memory-size 1024 \
  --environment "Variables={OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp, S3_BUCKET=YOUR_BUCKET, ...}"
```

Everything else (IAM role, secret, `ZIP_LOOKUP_S3_URI`, env vars, scheduling) is
identical to the zip path above.
