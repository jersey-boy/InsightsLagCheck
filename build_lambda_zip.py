"""
Build a Lambda deployment zip for the "zip + AWS-managed pandas layer" path.

This produces `lambda_deploy.zip` containing:
  * the application source (nb_insights.py, pull_zip_state_federal.py)
  * the dependencies that are NOT in the AWS-managed pandas layer, installed as
    Linux (manylinux) wheels so they run on the Lambda runtime.

pandas and numpy are intentionally EXCLUDED — they come from the AWS-managed
layer `AWSSDKPandas-Python312` attached to the function (see DEPLOY.md). boto3
is also excluded because it is already in the Lambda runtime.

Why a script (not `pip install` into a folder directly): on Windows, a plain
`pip install` grabs Windows wheels that will not run on Lambda. We force Linux
wheels with `--platform manylinux2014_x86_64 --only-binary=:all:`.

Usage (from the repo root, any OS with Python + pip):
    python build_lambda_zip.py
